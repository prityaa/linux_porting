sheduing workqueue in process context and mainly where bottom half can sleep
	in read can not use spin_lock since preemptioin and irq are disabled.

1 .
pci_probe drivers/firewire/ohci.c
	INIT_WORK(&ohci->bus_reset_work, bus_reset_work);

2 .
irq_handler	- drivers/firewire/ohci.c
	 queue_work(selfid_workqueue, &ohci->bus_reset_work);


3 . workqueue as bottom half is scheduled

bus_reset_work -
	find_and_insert_self_id	- drivers/firewire/ohci.c
		initiated_reset
			mutex_lock(&ohci->phy_reg_mutex)

ohci_read_phy_reg - drivers/firewire/ohci.c
	mutex_lock(&ohci->phy_reg_mutex);

	=> calling mutex_lock w.r.t read process context
